# RanSomewhere

Proof of Concept ransomware developed for educational purposes.

This ransomware encrypts all files in `C:\Users\` using RSA and AES-256 encryption.

This initial version is straightforward and does not include any anti-reverse engineering techniques. A subsequent version will be developed with advanced anti-reverse engineering features.
